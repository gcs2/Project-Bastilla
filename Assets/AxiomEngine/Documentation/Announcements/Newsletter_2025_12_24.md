**Subject:** STRATEGIC EVOLUTION: The "Axiom Shell" & The Text Adventure Pivot

## 🌟 THE PIVOT TO DURABILITY
Merry Christmas Eve! As 2025 draws to a close, **Project Bastilla** is undergoing a profound architectural evolution. While our visual goals for the Sun Eater remain as ambitious as ever, we have made a strategic decision to decouple our core gameplay logic from the volatility of the Unity View layer.

### 📜 Introducing: Text Adventure Verification (TAV)
We have identified that our reliance on the Unity Test Runner creates a "brittleness bottleneck." To ensure the Axiom Engine is truly "Great," we are introducing the **Axiom Shell**—a pure-logic harness that allows the game to be played, tested, and verified as a high-fidelity text adventure.

1.  **Logic-First Stability**: By verifying the "Vorgossos Incursion" purely through text commands, we ensure the math, dialogue trees, and quest states are indestructible before we even open the Unity Scene.
2.  **The "Axiom CLI"**: A new development interface for rapid iteration. Want to trigger a combat encounter? Just type it. No "Exit Code 1" can stop the logic flow.
3.  **Durable Verification**: This approach ensures that even as we upgrade URP settings or swap character models, the core "Sun Eater" experience remains perfectly balanced.

## 🛠️ SESSION RECAP: THE LAST 24 HOURS
1.  **GitHub Lock-In**: Successfully committed all Phase 27 visual and mechanical upgrades.
2.  **System Rules v1.3**: Mandated TAV as the primary verification gate for all new logic features.
3.  **Migration Path**: Tagged all legacy tests for transition to the new, faster CLI harness.
4.  **Neural-Link Refinement**: The "Humanism vs. Transhumanism" scaling is now mathematically verified and ready for the shell.

## 🚀 THE NEXT ENCOUNTER
Our next objective is the birth of the **Axiom Shell**. We will begin by implementing the command parser and porting the Vorgossos gameplay loop into a TAV Scenario. Once the text-adventure is playable and perfect, the Unity-style demo will inherit its rock-solid logic.

**"The logic is the soul. The spectacle is the body. Both shall be extraordinary."**
