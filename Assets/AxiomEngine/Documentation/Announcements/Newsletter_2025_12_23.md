# 🍾 THE AXIOM DISPATCH
**Date:** December 23, 2025  
**Subject:** VIBE CODING ASCENDANT: The Marketplace a Reality!

---

## 🌟 THE GOLDEN STATE ACHIEVED
We did it! In a single, high-intensity session, **Project Bastilla** has evolved from a fragmented codebase into a synchronized, Git-backed, and aesthetically-driven powerhouse. 

### 🟢 Breakthrough: The "Vorgossos" Vibe
Using the **Unity AI Assistant**, we successfully synthesized the first true visual asset for the Sun Eater demo: the **Marketplace Floor**.

## 🛠️ SESSION RECAP: WHAT WE BUILT
1.  **Cider-V Stabilization**: Achieved a 100% passing test suite across all 15 core engine tests. The "Golden State" is locked.
2.  **Git & GitHub Sync**: The project is now live at `https://github.com/gcs2/Project-Bastilla.git`.
3.  **One-Button Bootstrap**: Upgraded the `AxiomAssetImporter` to generate textured, lit, and structured environments with a single click.
4.  **Legacy Ingestion**: Preserved the original TDD and vision files for future reference.

## 🚀 THE NEXT ENCOUNTER
With the environment structurally and aesthetically initialized, our eyes turn to **NPC Integration**. Soon, the Chantry Inquisitor will walk these neon-lit halls, and the travelers of the Sun Eater will begin their journey.

**"The Sun Eater awaits. The vibe is immaculate."**
