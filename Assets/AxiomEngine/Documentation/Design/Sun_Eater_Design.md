# Axiom RPG Engine: Sun Eater Design Document 🪐🕯️

This document outlines the specific setting and mechanics for the **Sun Eater** implementation of the Axiom RPG Engine.

---

## 1. Setting: The Empire of Silence
The game is set in a science-fantasy future where humanity has spread across the stars, governed by the Chantry—a religious institution that strictly monitors technology and human evolution.

### Key Locations
- **Vorgossos**: A forbidden planet, home to the archives of the Quiet and the center of the vertical slice "Arrival at Vorgossos."

## 2. Morality System: Humanism vs. Transhumanism
The core conflict of the Sun Eater setting is the definition of "Humanity."

### 🏛️ Humanism (Positive Axis)
- **Philosophy**: Preservation of the natural human form. Rejection of high-AI and invasive cybernetics.
- **Support**: Backed by the Chantry.
- **Bonuses**: High Charisma, Defense, and "Faith" based abilities.
- **Weapons**: Elegant ballistics, energy shields, and matter-swords.

### 🧬 Transhumanist (Negative Axis)
- **Philosophy**: Evolution through technology. Cybernetics, genetic splicing, and neural uploads.
- **Support**: Underground research cells and radical factions.
- **Bonuses**: Increased Intelligence, Dexterity, and Speed. Access to "The Quiet" (reality-warping).
- **Weapons**: Neural-link weaponry, nanite swarms, and bio-warfare.
