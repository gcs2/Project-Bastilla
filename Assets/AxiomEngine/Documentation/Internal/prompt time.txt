Okay I'm convinced that the testing suite as it currently is implemented is broken beyond repair. And especially if we are to build something great, it is clearly far too brittle to be replied upon. I want to create a brand new testing strategy, perhaps using other tools or known testing frameworks you know about, weigh our options and proceed upon a coherent strategy. In addition, I want to live test with a sort of "text adventure game" approach. We want to make the Cider V approach durable even if we submit something. I think relying on Unity or whatever is not a good idea.
